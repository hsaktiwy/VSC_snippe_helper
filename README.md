In Visual Studio Code (VSCode), a "snippet" is a piece of reusable code or a template that you can insert into your source code with a shortcut or by typing a specific keyword and then triggering the snippet expansion. Snippets are a powerful feature that can save you time by allowing you to quickly insert common code patterns, boilerplate code, or even more complex structures.
